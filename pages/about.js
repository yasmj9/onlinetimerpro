                        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                        <p>
                            We believe that effective tools for health, wellness, and productivity should be
                            accessible to everyone, regardless of budget or technical expertise. Our multi-purpose
                            timer was created to eliminate barriers between you and your goals by providing
                            professional-grade timing tools that are completely free and easy to use.

                        <h2>Why We Built This Application</h2>
                        <p>
                            Traditional timing solutions often require expensive equipment, gym memberships,
                            or complicated apps with subscription fees. We recognized that many people were
                            using basic stopwatches or phone timers, which lack the specific features needed
                            for effective interval training, meditation practice, and focused work sessions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our timer bridges this gap by offering three specialized modes with customizable
                            settings, clear visual cues, audio notifications, and progress tracking - all the
                            features you need for successful HIIT workouts, peaceful meditation sessions,
                            and productive work using the Pomodoro technique.
